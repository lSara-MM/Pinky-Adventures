# {Pinky Adventures}

## Description

Join Pinky's new journey across the worlds to collect the Rosyte gemstones!
Simple platformer for the first assignment of Game Development.


## Key Features

* Double jump, which resets if you hit any platform, allowing to jump between walls.

* Beware! Portals may or may not help you.

* Your friends are here to help you when you get hurt. (Checkpoints)

* Collect the coins to get some points.

* Kill enemies by jumping onto them or use the special attack to kill them more safely, but remember, 
  this attack has a cooldown! (red sword icon means it can be used, brown means it's on cd)
